# Where is the Art?

This is a simple static site, deployed on Glitch, listing links and resources for learning about the history of computer art, and the use of [pen plotters](https://drawingbots.net/) in contemporary art creation. Originally, based on the Glitch static web starter template, then migrated to GH Pages.
